## 🏢 What I'm Up To Professionally:

I'm the brains and brawn behind a kickass company that's focused on Online Stores & Digital Marketing Solutions.

## 🎮 Just for Kicks:

When I'm off-duty, you'll find me in games, hunting down bugs like they're treasure.
It's my way of unwinding and getting a fresh perspective on the complexities of software development.
