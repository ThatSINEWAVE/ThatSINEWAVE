## 🎮 Fun Fact:

When I’m not coding or closing deals, I turn into a bug hunter in the gaming world. I love finding and researching game bugs—it’s like solving puzzles where each glitch unravels a new layer of complexity in software development.

## 🔍 On My GitHub:

You won't find your average commercial projects. Instead, I cherish this space for its freedom to explore, experiment, and express. Here, you'll discover:
- A tapestry of personal projects and conceptual ideas, each a glimpse into the spontaneous sparks of creativity I get.
- Experimental builds where I bring my whims and "what-ifs" to life, testing the waters of possibility with code.
